      question: "How does an AI body fat estimate work?",
      answer:
        "Upload a clear full-body photo and our body fat AI analyzes visual cues like body shape, fat distribution, and proportions to estimate your body fat percentage. This is a visual estimate, so lighting, pose, and clothing can affect results. For best accuracy, use a front-facing photo in good lighting.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is this an AI body fat calculator or a photo estimator?",
      answer:
        "It’s a photo-based AI body fat estimator. Traditional body fat calculators use formulas (like Navy measurements), while body fat AI estimates based on what your body looks like in the photo. You can use both: calculators are consistent; photo AI is a good visual reality-check.",
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is the body fat AI?",
      answer:
        "The body fat AI is designed to be directionally accurate for most people when the photo is clear and consistent. It’s not medical-grade like DEXA, but it can be useful for tracking trends over time. Accuracy improves with better photos and multiple photos when available.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to get an estimate?",
      answer:
        "Most AI body fat estimates are generated in under 20 seconds. Very large images or slow connections may take longer.",
    },
    {
      question: "What types of photos should I upload for best results?",
      answer:
        "Use a well-lit, full-body photo facing the camera head-on. Minimal or better-fitting clothing helps. Avoid harsh shadows, extreme angles, flexing, or baggy clothing. Only one person per photo.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the best AI for body fat estimates?",
      answer:
        "BodyFatEstimator.ai is designed to provide accurate photo-based body fat estimates using computer vision trained on body composition data. For best results, use clear photos and consistent conditions.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a free AI body fat estimator?",
      answer:
        "Yes. BodyFatEstimator.ai offers a free estimate using a single photo for a quick, rough result. For higher accuracy, the paid version supports multiple photo uploads and optional body stats such as height and weight to improve precision and consistency.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why does my estimate change when I upload different photos?",
      answer:
        "Because this is a visual estimate. Lighting, camera angle, distance, posture, and clothing can change how you appear in an image, and the AI reacts to that. For stable tracking, use consistent photo conditions each time.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if my result seems wrong?",
      answer:
        "Try again with a clearer photo: full-body, head-on, bright even lighting, neutral posture, and no baggy clothing. If you’re very muscular or carry fat in an uncommon pattern, photo estimation can be harder. Use the estimate as a trend signal, not a medical diagnosis.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does this work for men and women?",
      answer:
        "Yes. The AI body fat estimator is designed to work across body types. Accuracy depends heavily on photo quality and consistency.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is my data safe? Are my photos stored?",
      answer:
        "We prioritize privacy. Photos are processed to generate your estimate and are not sold or shared. We aim to minimize retention and delete data after processing whenever possible.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use this to track progress over time?",
      answer:
        "Yes. A single estimate can be noisy, but repeated estimates under the same conditions show trends. A good cadence is every 1–2 weeks.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is this free?",
      answer:
        "You can start with a free estimate. If you want higher accuracy, multiple photos, and more check-ins for tracking, there’s an upgrade option.",
    },
    {

          It’s a photo-based AI body fat estimator. Traditional “body fat calculators” usually
          estimate using formulas (like Navy measurements), while body fat AI estimates based on
          what your body looks like in the photo. If you want, you can use both: calculators are good for

          That’s the best use case. A single estimate can be noisy, but repeated estimates under the same conditions show
